# Testing browser use  

I used gpt4.1 and gemini 2.0 flash
results -> gemini is a little bit better, doesn't complicate stuff better
used some prompts 
theirs some results in [example](./example_result.py)

this tech is fascinating but theirs still more to improve,
like I can do more things than the ai based on tasks I have tested
Its a good start though

The feature I would like is human in the loop, 
like adding more information as the agent continues with the task,
I had some instance where the agent had a modal and it had to search for a product 
so the agent didn't think to close it instead it got confused, I had to stop it
also gemini has its limits: AFC is enabled with max remote calls: 10
not sure what it means

All of these are just my opinions based on what I have done, and they are subject to change
