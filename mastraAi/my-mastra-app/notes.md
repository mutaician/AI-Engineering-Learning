# Mastra Notes
> A well-crafted system prompt should include:
>
> - **Role definition**: What the agent is and what it does
> - **Core capabilities**: What tasks the agent can perform
> - **Behavioral guidelines**: How the agent should respond and interact
> - **Constraints**: What the agent should not do or discuss
> - **Success criteria**: What makes the agent's responses good
> - **Tools**: 

#### next extended agent additions
- Add more tools or use MCP to expand its capabilities (we will cover this in the next lesson)
- Implement more sophisticated memory storage
- Create a workflow that combines multiple agents
- Deploy your agent to a production environment


> ## What is MCP?
>
> MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that allows AI models to access external tools and services through a consistent interface. By integrating MCP servers with your Mastra agent, you can give it access to:
> - Email services like Gmail
> - Code repositories like GitHub
> - Social media platforms
> - Weather information
> - News sources
> - File systems
> - And many more services
