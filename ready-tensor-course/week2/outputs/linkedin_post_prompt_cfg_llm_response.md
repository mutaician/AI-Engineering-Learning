One model, five superpowers: VAEs in practice

If you work with data, this article is worth a read. It walks through Variational Autoencoders and shows five practical uses: compressing images, cleaning noisy data, making synthetic samples, spotting anomalies, and filling in missing values. The examples use MNIST and include runnable PyTorch code, reconstruction visuals, latent-space grids, and anomaly tests with letters.

What I liked was the focus on hands-on results. You can see how a small latent space still reconstructs digits. You can watch noise get removed. You can try sampling new digits and interpolating between styles. The piece also compares VAEs to GANs so you get a sense of when each makes sense.

If you want clear examples and code to try yourself, read the full publication. Itâ€™s a practical toolkit for anyone building ML pipelines that need generation, denoising, or imputation.
