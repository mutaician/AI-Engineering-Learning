Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a versatile class of generative, unsupervised neural networks that encode data into a probabilistic latent space, typically a Gaussian, and decode samples to reconstruct or generate new examples. Through the reparameterization trick, VAEs remain end-to-end differentiable, balancing reconstruction quality with regularization via KL divergence. Demonstrated on MNIST, VAEs compress images into a compact latent representation, generate new digits, denoise, detect anomalies, and impute missing data. Compared with traditional autoencoders and GANs, VAEs emphasize stability, interpretable latent structure, and explicit inference, enabling practical, adaptable AI applications in diverse domains.
