Variational Autoencoders or VAEs are flexible generative models that encode data into a probabilistic latent space and then decode it back. Using MNIST as a test bed, the article shows five practical powers: data compression, data generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection and missing data imputation. It explains the encoder, decoder and the reparameterization trick that makes training differentiable, and it provides a PyTorch example scaling digits into a compact latent space and reconstructing them. Beyond MNIST, VAEs offer steady training, interpretable latent representations, and useful comparisons with GANs for generation and inference.
