Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a flexible class of generative models that encode data into a probabilistic latent space and decode it back, using a reparameterization trick to keep training differentiable. The piece walks through the idea with a PyTorch example trained on MNIST, showing how VAEs can compress images, generate new digits, reduce noise, spot anomalies, and fill in missing data. It contrasts VAEs with traditional autoencoders and GANs, explains the loss terms like reconstruction plus KL divergence, and offers practical guidance on when VAEs are a good fit and how to get started.
