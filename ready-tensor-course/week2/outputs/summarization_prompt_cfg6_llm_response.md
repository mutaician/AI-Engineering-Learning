VAEs are shown as versatile deep learning models with five practical uses: data compression, data generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. The article uses MNIST to explain how a variational autoencoder encodes images into a probabilistic latent space and how the reparameterization trick enables end to end training. It includes a PyTorch example with encoder and decoder plus a loss that blends reconstruction accuracy and KL divergence. It also compares VAEs with GANs and suggests when a VAE is a sensible choice, plus simple latent space visualizations.

ReAct OUTPUT
========================================
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a type of unsupervised model that compress data into a probabilistic latent space and then rebuild it. This piece shows five practical uses on the MNIST handwritten digits: data compression, new data generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. It walks through the encoder and decoder parts, the reparameterization trick that keeps training smooth, and a loss that combines reconstruction with KL divergence. The article also compares VAEs with GANs and provides a PyTorch example, showing how these models can be trained and applied beyond digits.

Self-Ask OUTPUT
========================================
The article explains Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) as flexible unsupervised models that learn a probabilistic latent space to compress data and generate new samples. It covers the basic idea with an encoder and decoder, explains the reparameterization trick, and shows a PyTorch implementation trained on MNIST. It then demonstrates five practical uses, data compression, data generation, denoising, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation, along with visuals and a comparison to GANs. It also helps readers decide when VAEs suit a project and points to hands-on experimentation.
